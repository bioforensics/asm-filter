# Assembly Tools
Assembly utility workflows used to assemble bacterial isolates sequenced on illumina paired end sequencers.

Scripts used to assemble five historical Bacillus anthracis assemblies to be published in Microbiology Resource Annoucements (http://mra.asm.org).  

The assemblies have been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession numbers (SAMN12620928, SAMN12620929, SAMN12620930, SAMN12620931, SAMN12620932).  The raw Illumina paired end sequencing reads are archived in the SRA under the accession numbers (SRR10019497, SRR10019498, SRR10019499, SRR10019500, SRR10019501).
